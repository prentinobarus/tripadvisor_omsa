0, Mambo Beach Resort,"The cocktails were delicious, especially the ""Penida passion cocktail"" and the ""Indigo Vodka Lime"". The staff was incredibly friendly and had a great sense of humor. During my girlfriend's birthday dinner, they sang to her with the live band and gave her a treat, which was a lovely touch. The resort has a beautiful beach vibe and is a stunning place to stay. The food was also great, whether you're in the mood for Asian cuisine or a dish like loaded fries.",5
1, Mambo Beach Resort,"Accomodation is amazing. Pool at your doorstep with beach views just in front. Great menu for lunch and dinner. Diving centre is great, great dives and great dive crew, dive guides and excellent selection of hire gear. ",5
2, Mambo Beach Resort,Cet hôtel est parfait que vous soyez là pour plonger ou pas. L’équipe est génial et le spot incroyable. On est au calme comme jamais et pourtant on ne s’ennuie jamais. On comme des poissons dans l’eau ici. On recommande à 100% de venir un jour ou une semaine,5
3, Mambo Beach Resort,"A good small hotel with a really nice beach vibe to it. Had an upstairs room which had a nice view of sea and beach, great to wake up to each day, it can be quite windy at night so would suggest using the earplugs provided if you are a light sleeper.The breakfast included was a little limited in options for me (being vegan) but still tasty, there were more options in the main menu which was good to explore, with a nice balance of local and other food. On site dive centre is good and I had 3 great dives with John, professional and well run.Overall would recommend a good place to stay on the island, particularly if you're looking to include some diving in your itinerary.",4
4, Mambo Beach Resort,"在mambo住了三晚，每天早上拉开窗帘就是“啊，天呐，太漂亮了吧”。整个海边的布置是有精心打理过，还有花花的配色，加上大海和木质沙滩桌椅，真的太美了。之前我也有来过巴厘，但不得不说mambo的景色是所有住宿里面最漂亮的，如果不是因为第四晚开始他们没有房间了，一点也不想搬走。  在这里也考了OWC的潜水证，Doris会说中文，所以整个教学过程都很顺利，也安全感十足，但因为佩尼达的流比较大，我下水的时候还是太紧张，所以没有做得特别好，以后可以多回来练习练习吧。  最后说说食物，只点了印尼当地的菜系，都很不错，价格也很合理，喜欢喝酒的还有happy hour , 我们有两顿晚餐都是在餐厅吃的。",5
5, Mambo Beach Resort,We were here for one night.Very nice place! Friendly stuff! I like it. The room is cute and very clean. The pool on the outside is also very nice.  You should stay at this very very nice hotel on nusa penida.  ,4

16, Mambo Beach Resort,Great room and views. Staff very friendly and created a great atmosphere of beach chilling! The food and drinks could be better. The Audi an food was really good but the western food did not taste that great. And the cocktails were lacking alcohol. ,4
17, Mambo Beach Resort,Had a really amazing stay. The room more than exceeded my expectations. Definitely coming back. Anyone coming to Nusa Penida should visit. They also have a beach front restaurant on sight which plays live music some nights. Worth the money,5

20, Mambo Beach Resort,One of the few occasions where expectations lived up to reality. The customer service was amazing. Every single staff member went out of their way to make our stay memorable.

22, Mambo Beach Resort,"Very nice hotel, with cosy rooms, 2 nice swimming pools, bar & restaurant, diving center.  We had a really pleasant stay and we ate plenty of good food! The only downside is the traffic from the nearby road that you can hear until 10-11 pm. But luckily it stops during the night. :) ",4
23, Mambo Beach Resort,Amazing room and even better dive at Manta Point! Ill give them 6 stars if i can....pak Bobby was an excellent dive master take took us down straight to a manta on 1st 1st dive!  Strongly suggest to stay a night here and do the dive the next day.

27, Mambo Beach Resort,The room and aurroundings are very stylish. Plenty opportunities to make Instagram photos if you're into that. You can see the ocean straight from your bedroom! I and my wife took snorkeling trip from this place well. It was super convenient - boat leaves straight from hotel. Staff was extremely helpful and kept everyone in a good mood. Saw a bunch of manta rays as well as a turtle! On the way back we accidentally even stumbled on a pack of dolphins!,5
28, Mambo Beach Resort,We really enjoyed the snorkeling trip with the crew from the Mambo beach diving resort. We were properly introduced before the trip and had a guide in the water who helped us to navigate around magnificent coral reefs. We saw amazing Mantra fish ans also some dolphins on the way to snorkeling spot. That was an amazing experience! Thank you Mambo beach for the trip.,5
29, Mambo Beach Resort,"Great vibes, friendly staff, super clean rooms and delicious food.  The diving center is also great, we dove most of our stay with John! Truly enjoyed it.  Recommended Manta point 💕 the wall and ask them about the best sites. They really know the reefs very well! ",5
30, Mambo Beach Resort,"All around amazing place! From the dive center to the restaurant and hotel rooms, everything N was incredible. Diving with Mantas was a bucket list experience and John was the best guide (for all of our dives - we ended up doing extra because the place is perfect). The rooms are cute and convenient. The restaurant has an extensive menu - coconut shakes highly recommended! ",5
31, Mambo Beach Resort,"The resort itself is very new and clean. The staff are excellent, and will go out of their way to help you. The beachside cafe is very popular. It has lots of seating in various forms, and it perfect for a beer while watching the sunset. It is fairly convenient with other restaurants within a 30 minute walk.   The best part of the resort would have to be the dive centre! The convenience of having the dive centre on site is very handy for those who are diving/ snorkelling, and the dive masters are amazing!   The only constructive feedback I have is around soundproofing and hanging space in the rooms.   Firstly, there is no soundproofing in the rooms. You can constantly hear noise from outside, including cars and bikes from the road that is only a few metres away, music from the…",4
32, Mambo Beach Resort,"Very nice staff and great location by the beach :)  Been at the resturant good for vegiterians. Also a dive center, one of the ceaper once. Would be a great place to stay aswell since they also have accomodation.",5

35, Mambo Beach Resort,"Perfect stay in a perfect location! The food in the restaurant is really good with live music, the snorkeling tour to see manta rays is also highly recommended. Great place to stay in your trip in nusa penida! ",5

41, Mambo Beach Resort,"I have a very relaxing trip with best sleep I have in months with the sound of wave as lullaby. Set by the beach, with very friendly staff, clean and comfortable bed, and nice food, it was an amazing stay.",5
42, Mambo Beach Resort,"Das Hotel an sich sieht schön aus, hat aber eher den Flair eines Hostels (wenn man das mag). Das inkludierte Frühstück ist sehr basic und überhaupt nicht flexibel für kleine Änderungen. Das Essen ist im Vergleich zu anderen Orten auch nur okay, Cocktails gut aber kein kaltes Bier oder Wein im Glas. Am Abend gab es Live-Musik, was eine schöne Atmosphäre geschaffen hat. Das Hotel ist genau am Strand. Der Strand ist sandig, aber im Wasser kann man nicht wirklich schwimmen, da dort Steine und tote Korallen am Boden liegen. Insgesamt ist der Preis im Vergleich zu anderen Hotels, in denen wir auf Bali waren, für den gebotenen Service/Qualität viel zu hoch.",3
43, Mambo Beach Resort,"Mambo beach resort is beautifully located on the beach, with great views of the sea. We stayed here for two nights, and enjoyed both. They had live music on both nights which was lovely to listen to on our balcony.  Unfortunately, the scuba diving and snorkelling at Manta Point were fully booked during our stay, therefore we were no unable to do it (so I would definitely pre book if possible). So we ended up spending the two days on the resort, which was lovely just to chill by the sea, listen to the sea and recharge the batteries after a busy time travelling the main land of Bali.  Overall, the Mambo resort is a great place to stay.",5
44, Mambo Beach Resort,"Nice stay, location is very good, in front of the beach.  The rooms are clean and all have sea view.  The breakfast is simple but nice. We enjoyed the live music in the evening. The music will not go on till late so you can have a good night rest.",4

We really enjoyed the live music every evening.   Rooms were perfect and also super clean.   Thank you to all the staff for making our stay wonderful! ",5
46, Mambo Beach Resort,Super schönes und entspanntes Hotel. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und bemüht. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen. Insbesondere kann ich das Essen und den Schorchel Trip zu den Mantas empfehlen! ,4
47, Mambo Beach Resort,"Goede service, lekker eten en bovenal een relaxte sfeer in het beach café. Heerlijke plek om na een actieve dag bij te komen met een cocktail. Wij zijn hier 2 dagen geweest en dat was eigenlijk net te kort, maar toch nog voldoende kunnen zien van Nusa Penida.",5
48, Mambo Beach Resort,"This place is great. I loved my upstairs room - felt private, everything was well-made, clean, and the bed was the most comfortable bed/pillow combo I had in four months of traveling SE Asia. The diving was so beautiful!!! Thank you, Team Mambo.",5
49, Mambo Beach Resort,"Amazing beach resort nice beach view, Good ambiance with live music at night  Staff is very helpful. Clean beach with bar lounge Breakfast is also good  Comfortable room with beach view balcony  Definitely recommend ",5

53, Mambo Beach Resort,"Putu Diana has been such a friendly host remembering our names and helping above and beyond, answering questions as well as serving breakfast and cleaning our rooms. His other colleague Putu who helped us with bike rentals too deserves a special mention - she was great! We've had 3 amazing days here. The pool is gorgeous as is the beach bar... the rooms too! Would love to stay a few more nights, but sadly moving on! Fergal",5

The rooms all have sea view and some have direct access to the pool :-) The food and drinks were delicious. The staff is extremely careful and friendly! Tours of the integrated diving school can be booked at the reception. We booked a boat trip to Manta Point. We can really recommend this tour. It was an amazing experience to snorkel with manta rays :-) We enjoyed our stay very much.",5
60, Mambo Beach Resort,"We spent 4 nights at the Mambo Beach Resort. It is a very nice little resort right on the beach. Our room had a terrace with direct access to the pool and sea view. The food and drinks, which can also be ordered from the pool, were very tasty. :-) It was clean, the staff very friendly and attentive!  Tours can be booked at the reception and scooters can be rented. The resort also has a diving school. We booked a tour to Manta Point. We can really recommend this tour. 9.00 am we started from the accommodation with the boat. You could snorkel or dive. While snorkeling we saw about 5 big mantas. That was really great. During the tour we felt very safe. At the end we had a delicious meal.",5
61, Mambo Beach Resort,"Good food, mesmerizing views and top notch service, plus a great diving experience. The live music at the cafe was a great bonus! What more can you ask for? All I can say is, this was worth every penny.",5

The rooms overlook the ocean, are very cute, comfortable and clean, with modern amenities - they also provide a welcome pack with sunscreen toothbrush/toothpaste, etc. which was a nice touch.  The garden/restaurant area is very picturesque, and there’s live music in the evenings. Food is tasty and the drinks are great! Communication with the Mambo team was very easy, and they were very accomodating during my stay.  I also did my PADI Open Water course with Mambo and had an amazing experience!

68, Mambo Beach Resort,"발리 옆 작은 섬, 누사 페니다 며칠간 다녀온 장문의 후기를 남겨 봅니다.  발리 공항에 내리니 이곳이 발리구나 라는 생각이 들 정도로 외국인이 많았다. 한번도 누사 페니다 섬을 가본적이 없어서 어떻게 갈지 걱정이었는데 예약한 Mambo Resort에서 섬까지 들어가는 교통편을 도움을 줘서 쉽게 갈 수 있었다. 유튜브를 보니 모래 해변을 거쳐 배를 타면 옷이랑 짐이 젖을 수 있다는 얘기를 듣고 걱정을 했는데 선착장을 통해 섬까지 들어가는 배편도 많아 쉽게 건너갈 수 있었다. 선착장에 내리니 Mambo Resort 차량이 대기하고 있어서 쉽게 숙소까지 도착했다.  도착하는 순간 너무 예쁘게 꾸며진 리조트에 반했다. 2022년에 오픈해서 그런지 너무 깨끗하고 잘 정돈된 느낌, 직원들도 너무 친절해서 좋았다. 숙소 2층에 들어가니 바다가 한 눈에 보여서 힐링되는 최고의 뷰 숙소 실내와 화장실도 너무 좋았고 쾌적한 실내 공기에 만족도가 최고였다. 사실 이 리조트의 장점은 스킨 스쿠버를 배울 수 있는 풀장이 따로 있다는 것. 초보자들도 배우면 금방 다이빙을 배울 수 있어서 좋은 것 같다. 한번도 다이빙을 해본 적이 없어서 스노쿨링만 하기로 했지만 다음에 오면 꼭 다이빙을 해보리라….. 첫날 저녁은 야외 공연장에서 수준있는 70~80년대 팝송을 들을 수 있어서 추억의 감성을 자극한다.  둘째날은 리조트에 2대의 배가 있는데 샬롯호를 타고 만타 가오리를 볼 수 있는 포인트로 이동. 보트를 타고 40분 정도를 달려 도착, 누사 페니다 섬이 관광지로 개발을 시작한 것이 2016년부터 여서 그런지 바닷물이…",5
69, Mambo Beach Resort,"Great and very stylish room , pool in front, great pressure at the shower , comfortable bed , free water in the room -big bottles , and a complimentary bag with sun screen , mosquito repellent and a lot of other things , staff is very nice , would stay there again ! ",5
70, Mambo Beach Resort,"Fantastic hotel, food and cocktails. We don’t want to leave! The room looked out onto the beach and we were right next to mambos top tier dive school.

The architecture was very stylish and the staff are very friendly.   We walked along the beach while checking out other hotels but it seemed like Mambo Beach Resort was the nicest(and hippest) one.

The breakfast package kicked off our day with healthy sevivings or noodles, rice or eggs and toast. Accompanied by tea or coffee and juice or fruit.

94, Mambo Beach Resort,Nice crew… Good equipment … Had to pay in advance which felt weird but understandable because people make a reservation and than don’t come … but still felt weird because I’m used to something else. Enjoy your dives ! ,5

98, Mambo Beach Resort,We really enjoyed our stay and loved the beach view from our room. We also did a snorkelling trip through the hotel and it was very well run (and we got to see the manta rays). Happy hour cocktails very good and excellent price. All around very nice.,5
99, Mambo Beach Resort,"Läget går inte att få bättre. Ligger precis vid stranden. Trevlig restaurang. Boendet är fräscht. Standarden är ok, rent och fint men ganska avskalat. Livemusik till 21 på kvällen vilket var trevligt. Värt att veta är att det ligger en karaokebar på andra sidan gatan som håller igång längre, störde inte mig men det har inte varit tyst på natten pga det. Lugnt boende annars. De ordnar turer för dykning och snorkling och hjälpte oss hitta en chaufför för att se ön. Rekommenderas!",5
100, Mambo Beach Resort,"We booked the delux double room  with balcony and sea view for 4 nights and had an wonderful relaxing experince. You have wainting in the room a welcome care package that includes an anti mosquite spray and other toiletries. The bed was very comfortable and the room specious. There are options to chose from where to stay at the beach. They have spaces to have food and drinks near the ocean. The brekafast was very tasty and you get to choose what you want. Free water refill available. Also , the dive shop at the property has some fun ocean experiences that you can try.",5

103, Mambo Beach Resort,"Magnifique endroit, décoré avec amour et beaucoup de goût. Toute l’équipe est aux petits soins, le centre de plongée est très qualitatif (John était incroyable), le restaurant est excellent (le meilleur de l’île) et les chambres trop belles avec toutes une vue et un balcon sur la mer ! Les jeudi, vendredi et samedi soir pour avec un concert de Bobby sur la plage, magnifique, mon plus beau souvenir à Bali !  J’ai prolongé mon séjour tellement j’ai adoré Mambo Beach 😍 Même quand il pleut, c’est un endroit où il fait beau et bon vivre.",5
104, Mambo Beach Resort,"I and my friends spent the end of 2022 at this place. this is a very great experience, the room is very beautiful with eco-friendly design.   All rooms have a direct view of the beach. The rooms and all corners are clean, and also they have a restaurant with western food or Indonesian traditional food, we tried both and nothing disappointed, everything was delicious. The cocktails are very good. So if I go to Bali and there is an opportunity to go to Nusa Penida again, Mambo Resort will be my top choice to visit again.",5

106, Mambo Beach Resort,"We stayed 4 nights at Mambo Beach Resort and it was totally worth it. The fantastic views from our room, the always-smiling staff and the 30 seconds walk to the beach are the main things to remember. The rooms are very comfortable. There is a laundromat and a spot to rent scooters that you can walk to in 1 minute  from the resort. 100% would come again.",5

108, Mambo Beach Resort,I had a good time at Mambo Resort. The resort is charming and I like the colorful roofs. The room itself is very clean and beautifully decorated. The bed and pillows are comfortable. It has great attention to details for all the guests’s need. The shower water in the bathroom is hot and it has strong pressure. The bed and pillows are also very comfortable. The room has direct access to the swimming pool. The resort also has a beachfront restaurant that sells various kind of foods and drinks. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. Overall I really enjoyed my stay.,5
109, Mambo Beach Resort,"Wir waren 6 Nächte hier und haben unseren Aufenthalt mehr als genossen! Die Anlage ist sauber, sehr gemütlich eingerichtet und das Personal ist super lieb und herzlich! Ich würde dieses Resort auf jeden Fall empfeheln! Auch die hauseigene Tauchschule ist top, mit modernem Equipment! Love this place!!",5
110, Mambo Beach Resort,"I stayed 6 days @ Mambo Dive Resort and loved it. The resort itself is pretty new and you can tell. Everything is taken care into detail. The external areas are very charming, lots of tiny lights and plants hanging and creating a warm atmosphere. You can seat upstairs in a covered area, or downstairs, open air right by the beach. A couple of pools (one mainly used by the dive shop) facing the sea. Bali is in front of the resort, right across the sea, and with no couds, you can see the mount Agung just as you open your the window doors of your room. Great view from the upstairs rooms. Rooms are cosy and taken care in the smallest detail. The linoleum floor may not be as natural as nude wood, but I imagine it is done to smoothen the noise on the rooms downstairs. Rooms are…",5

112, Mambo Beach Resort,Me and my two friends had a great stay at the Mambo Beach and Dive resort. The rooms are great with a comfy bed and air condition. With a beautiful sea view and a private pool area. The staff are absolutely adorable and helpful. Nusan and Tari helped us out when needed. Only downside to the place is that the Wi-Fi doesn’t reach to the pool area. But would definitely recommend staying here and would love to come back.,5
113, Mambo Beach Resort,"The resort has all the luxury touches, with great vibes and ambience, unique design, good service, cozy room, great pool area and friendly staff which makes it a great place to spend your holiday with your family. ",5
